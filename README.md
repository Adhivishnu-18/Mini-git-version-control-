# MyGit - Mini Version Control System


---

##  Introduction

Mini Git is a simplified version control system developed in C++ that replicates the essential functionality of Git. This project serves as an educational implementation to understand the internal workings of version control systems, including file hashing, object storage, data compression, and commit tracking.

The system implements 13 core Git commands that enable users to initialize repositories, track file changes, create commits, and navigate through project history. Built using modern C++ standards, the project demonstrates practical application of data structures, algorithms, cryptographic hashing (SHA-1), and file system operations.

**Key learning objectives achieved through this implementation include:**
- Understanding Git's internal object model (blobs, trees, commits)
- Implementing cryptographic hashing for content integrity
- Working with zlib compression for efficient storage
- Managing staging areas and commit workflows
- Creating command-line interfaces for version control operations

---

##  Commands Implemented and Usage

### 2.1 Repository Management

#### **init - Initialize Repository**

**Purpose:** Creates a new Mini Git repository in the current directory

**Usage:**
```bash
./mygit init
```

**Output:**
```
.mygit Git directory created successfully
```

**What it does:**
- Creates .mygit/ directory structure
- Initializes objects/, refs/heads/, logs/ folders
- Creates empty index and HEAD files
- Sets up the foundation for version control

---

#### **status - Check Repository Status**

**Purpose:** Shows the current state of files in the working directory

**Usage:**
```bash
./mygit status
```

**Sample Output:**
```
HEAD commit: a1b2c3d4...

Changes to be committed:
	new file:   file1.txt
	modified:   file2.txt

Changes not staged for commit:
	modified:   file3.txt

Untracked files:
	newfile.txt
```

**What it shows:**
- Files ready to be committed (staged)
- Modified files not yet staged
- New files not being tracked

---

### 2.2 File Management

#### **add - Stage Files for Commit**

**Purpose:** Adds files to the staging area

**Usage:**
```bash
./mygit add filename.txt      # Add single file
./mygit add folder/           # Add entire folder
./mygit add .                 # Add all files
```

**Output:**
```
Added to staging area: filename.txt
SHA-1: a1b2c3d4e5f6...
Blob object written to: .mygit/objects/a1/b2c3d4e5f6...
```

**What it does:**
- Calculates SHA-1 hash of file content
- Creates blob object in .mygit/objects/
- Updates index with file information

---

#### **hash-object - Create Object Hash**

**Purpose:** Computes SHA-1 hash of a file

**Usage:**
```bash
./mygit hash-object filename.txt       # Just show hash
./mygit hash-object -w filename.txt    # Store in repository
```

**Output:**
```
SHA-1: a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890abcd
Blob object written to: .mygit/objects/a1/b2c3d4e5f6789...
```

---

#### **cat-file - View Object Contents**

**Purpose:** Displays information about repository objects

**Usage:**
```bash
./mygit cat-file -p a1b2c3d4...    # Show content
./mygit cat-file -t a1b2c3d4...    # Show type
./mygit cat-file -s a1b2c3d4...    # Show size
```

**Sample Output:**

**-p flag (print content):**
```
Hello, World!
This is file content.
```

**-t flag (show type):**
```
blob
```

**-s flag (show size):**
```
32
```

---

### 2.3 Commit Operations

#### **commit - Create Commit**

**Purpose:** Creates a permanent snapshot of staged changes

./mygit commit -m "Your commit message"
```

**Output:**
```
f7e8d9c2b1a098765432109876543210fedcba09
```

**What it does:**
- Creates tree object from staged files
- Generates commit object with metadata
- Updates HEAD to point to new commit
- Clears staging area

---

#### **log - View Commit History**

**Purpose:** Displays commit history

**Usage:**
```bash
./mygit log
```

**Sample Output:**

### 2.4 Tree Operations

#### **write-tree - Create Tree Object**

**Purpose:** Creates tree object from current directory

**Usage:**
```bash

Restored file: file1.txt
Restored file: file2.txt
Created directory: subfolder
Successfully checked out commit f7e8d9c2b1a0987...
```

**Important Warning:** This overwrites current files. Consider backing up your work first.

 **Recommendation:** Create another folder, copy ".mygit" and the executable file "mygit" to the folder you created.

#### **reset - Undo Changes**

**Purpose:** Various reset operations to undo changes

**Usage:**
```bash
./mygit reset                          # Unstage all files

./mygit reset --hard f7e8d9c2b1a0...  # Reset to commit
```

**Sample Outputs:**

**Basic reset:**
```
Index cleared successfully
```

**File-specific reset:**
```
Unstaged 'filename.txt'
```

**Hard reset:**
```
Resetting to commit f7e8d9c2b1a0987...
